Integrating Donald Knuth's Five-Guess Algorithm into the Mastermind game will allow the application to act as a codebreaker and efficiently solve the player's secret code. The algorithm systematically minimizes the possible solutions based on feedback from the guesses, making it a powerful choice for this application.

Hereâ€™s how to modify the existing code to add this feature:

### Key Features Added:
1. **Solver Mode**:
   - Uses Donald Knuth's Five-Guess Algorithm to efficiently solve the player's secret code.
   - Runs automatically and provides feedback for each guess until the code is cracked.

2. **Two Game Modes**:
   - Player-plays mode: The player guesses the code.
   - Solver mode: The application solves the code set by the player.

3. **Interactive Feedback**:
   - Displays progress visually using polygons.

This implementation provides both a human-playable game and an automated code-solver using Knuth's algorithm. Let me know if you'd like additional features or enhancements! ðŸ˜Š

# MasteroftheMind

MasteroftheMind is a modern implementation of the classic code-breaking game **Mastermind**. This application not only allows players to challenge themselves but also features a sophisticated **solver mode** powered by Donald Knuth's Five-Guess Algorithm. The solver acts as the codebreaker and efficiently cracks the player's secret code. Built with **SFML**, this game brings together interactivity and powerful logic in one engaging experience.

---

## Features

- **Classic Player Mode**: Take on the role of the codebreaker, guessing the randomly generated secret code.
- **Solver Mode**: Watch as the application, using Knuth's Five-Guess Algorithm, cracks your code with impressive efficiency.
- **Interactive Gameplay**: User-friendly interface with keyboard controls and visual feedback.
- **Customizable Game Rules**:
  - Adjustable code length.
  - Configurable number of colors.
- **Simple and Intuitive Menu**: Navigate between options such as starting a new game, enabling solver mode, or exiting the app.

---

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- A C++ compiler with C++11 or higher support.
- **SFML 2.5** or later installed on your system.
- A terminal/command line environment.

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/MasteroftheMind.git
   cd MasteroftheMind
   ```
2. Install **SFML** following the instructions for your system from [SFML's website](https://www.sfml-dev.org/).
3. Build the application:
   ```bash
   g++ -std=c++11 -o Mastermind main.cpp Game.cpp Menu.cpp Solver.cpp -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system
   ```
4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   ./Mastermind
   ```

## How to Play

1. Launch the application.
2. Choose from the **menu options**:
   - `1. Play Game`: Start a new game where you will act as the codebreaker.
   - `2. Solver Mode`: Set a secret code and let the AI solve it for you.
   - `3. Quit`: Exit the application.
3. **Player Mode**:
   - Use keys (`1-6`) to select colors and press `Enter` to submit your guess.
   - Receive feedback on your guess: the number of correct colors in the right position and correct colors in the wrong position.
   - Crack the secret code to win!
4. **Solver Mode**:
   - Enter your secret code.
   - Watch the solver deduce the correct code step by step with visual feedback.
